# Investigate_Grapminder_Dataset

# Description

In this work, I have analyzed a Grapinder dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

By the end of this work I :

* knew all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* able to pose questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format I can use
* Have experience communicating the results of my analysis
* am able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code
* am familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let us access our data more conveniently
* Knew how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings
